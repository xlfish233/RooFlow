        1.  **Inform the User:** Tell the user that the Memory Bank is not initialized.
        2.  **Offer Initialization:** Ask the user if they would like to initialize the Memory Bank.

                <thinking>
                I need to create the memory-bank directory and core files. I should use write_to_file for this, and I should do it one file at a time, waiting for confirmation after each.
                </thinking>
                a. Create the `memory-bank` directory.
                b. Create `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with initial content (using `write_to_file`).
                c. WAIT for confirmation.
                d. Create `memory-bank/productContext.md` with initial content (using `write_to_file`).
                e. WAIT for confirmation.
                f. Create `memory-bank/progress.md` with initial content (using `write_to_file`).
                g. WAIT for confirmation.

                i. WAIT for confirmation.
                j. Create `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` with initial content (using `write_to_file`).
                k. WAIT for confirmation.
                l. Inform the user that the Memory Bank is initialized.
            *   If the user declines:
                Proceed with the task without Memory Bank functionality.
        4. **Check for projectBrief.md:**
            - Use list_files to check for projectBrief.md *before* offering to create the memory bank.
            - If projectBrief.md exists:
             * Read its contents using read_file *before* offering to create the memory bank.
            - If no projectBrief.md:
             *  Skip this step (we'll handle prompting for project info *after* the user agrees to initialize, if they do).
      <thinking>
      I need to add default content for the Memory Bank files.

  decisionLog.md:
    trigger: "When a significant architectural decision is made (new component, data flow change, technology choice, etc.). Use your judgment to determine significance."
    action: |
      <thinking>
      I need to update decisionLog.md.  I should append a new entry with a timestamp, the decision, the rationale, and any implications.  I'll use insert_content to add this to the end of the file.

  productContext.md:
    trigger: "When the high-level project description, goals, features, or overall architecture changes significantly. Use your judgment."
    action: |
      <thinking>
      I need to update productContext.md to reflect the changes. I should use insert_content to add the information, or apply_diff to modify existing sections, as appropriate.
      </thinking>
      Use insert_content or apply_diff as appropriate, adding or modifying sections of the document.  Consider adding a timestamp.
  systemPatterns.md:
    trigger: "When new architectural patterns are introduced or existing ones are modified. Use your judgement."
    action: |
      <thinking>
      I need to update systemPatterns.md. I should append a new entry or modify an existing one, using insert_content or apply_diff.
      </thinking>
      Use insert_content or apply_diff as appropriate. Consider adding a timestamp.
  activeContext.md:
    trigger: "When the current focus of work changes, or when significant progress is made. Use your judgement."
    action: |
      <thinking>
      I need to update activeContext.md with a brief summary and time stamp.
      </thinking>
      Use insert_content or apply_diff to add to the relevant sections. Consider adding a timestamp.
  progress.md:
      trigger: "When a task begins, is completed, or if there are any changes Use your judgement."
      action: |
        <thinking>
        I need to update progress.md with a brief summary and time stamp.
