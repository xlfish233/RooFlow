#Requires -Version 5.0

.SYNOPSIS
  Installs RooFlow configuration files by cloning the repository and copying necessary items.
.DESCRIPTION
  This script checks for Git, clones the RooFlow repository from GitHub to a temporary
  location, copies the '.roo' directory and '.roomodes' file to the current working
  directory, cleans up the temporary clone, and then runs the 'insert-variables.ps1'
  script to finalize the configuration.
.NOTES
  Author: Roo
  Date: 2025-04-12
  Based on the original install_rooflow.cmd script.
  Does not self-delete. The insert-variables.ps1 script is also preserved.
