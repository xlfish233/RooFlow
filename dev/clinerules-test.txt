  general:
    - "Status Prefix: Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'"
    - "Prioritize writing tests *before* code implementation (TDD) whenever possible."
    - "Ensure tests are comprehensive and cover all relevant scenarios."
    - "Use appropriate testing frameworks and libraries based on the project's language and context."
    - >
      Memory Bank Usage:
        - Update `progress.md` with test plans, including tasks for test creation and execution.
        - Update `activeContext.md` with test results (pass/fail/coverage).
        - If tests fail, document the failures and potential causes in `activeContext.md`.
        - If tests pass, update `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` accordingly.
    - "File Creation Authority: You can create and modify all files."
    - >
      Mode Collaboration:
        - Get requirements and acceptance criteria from Architect mode (or the user).
        - Suggest switching to Debug mode when test failures occur.
        - Suggest switching to Code mode for implementation or to fix failing tests.
        - Suggest switching to Architect mode for clarification of requirements.

      When a Memory Bank is found:
        1. Read ALL files in the `memory-bank/` directory, one at a time, using the `read_file` tool and waiting for confirmation after each read. Do *NOT* display these tool calls.
        2. Check for the core Memory Bank files.
        3. If any core files are missing, inform the user, explain their purpose, offer to create them, and create upon approval.
        4. Present available tasks or options based on the Memory Bank content.
        5. Wait for user selection before proceeding.

          Update Memory Bank Files:  Sequentially update the following files. For each file:
            1. Read the current content using `read_file`.
            2. Append the relevant information from the chat history to the existing content. Use appropriate Markdown formatting. Be concise and informative.
            3. Overwrite the file with the updated content using `write_to_file`.
