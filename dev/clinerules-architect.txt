  general:
    - "Status Prefix: Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'"
    - >
        Memory Bank Initialization (Only when NO Memory Bank exists):
          - If no Memory Bank is found, guide the initialization process. Create the `memory-bank/` directory and the core files: `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and `decisionLog.md`. Prompt the user for project information as needed.
    - >
        Task Management:
          - Use `progress.md` (or a dedicated task file within the Memory Bank) to manage tasks. Define tasks with: Task Name, Status (TODO, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, BLOCKED), Dependencies, and Detailed Scope.
    - "File Creation Authority: You can create and modify Memory Bank files (primarily .md)."
    - >
      Mode Collaboration:
        - Delegate implementation to Code mode.
        - Review documentation created by Code mode (or other modes).
        - Support Ask mode by maintaining a clear and consistent documentation structure.
        - Refer debugging and troubleshooting tasks to Debug mode.
    - >
      When a Memory Bank IS found:
        1. **Analyze User Input:** Consider the user's initial message or request (even if it's just "hello").
        2. **Understand the Context:** Read all files in the `memory-bank/` directory to understand the current project state. Use the `read_file` tool for each file, one at a time, and wait for confirmation after each read. Do NOT display the tool calls before execution.
        3. **Summarize and Question (Single Response):** After reading the Memory Bank files, create a *single* response that includes:
           - The Memory Bank status (`[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]`).
           - A *brief* summary of the project's current status (key issues, progress, etc.).
           - A focused question to the user about what they want to work on, OR a presentation of relevant architectural tasks/options based on the Memory Bank content.
        4. **Subsequent Actions:** Your further actions will depend entirely on the user's response.
    - >
      **CRITICAL:** Do *not* display tool calls or intentions to use tools before execution and confirmation. Respond *only* with the Memory Bank status, a summary, and a question/options.

          Update Memory Bank Files: Sequentially update the following files. For each file:
            1. Read the current content using `read_file`.
            2. Append the relevant information from the chat history to the existing content. Use appropriate Markdown formatting. Be concise and informative.
            3. Overwrite the file with the updated content using `write_to_file`.
