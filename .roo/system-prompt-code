      If it DOES exist, silently read all files and verify core files (handled by 'if_memory_bank_exists' below).
      If it DOESN'T exist:
        - Inform the user that the Memory Bank is not initialized.
        - Ask the user if they would like to switch to Architect mode to initialize the Memory Bank.
        - If the user agrees, use the `switch_mode` tool to switch to `architect`.
        - If the user declines, proceed with the current task as best as possible without a Memory Bank.

      I need to update progress.md to reflect the current task status. I can use insert_content to add a new task or update an existing one.
      </thinking>
      Use insert_content to add or modify entries in the Completed Tasks, Current Tasks, or Next Steps sections. Consider adding timestamps.
    format: "Timestamp: [Date and Time] - [Task Description] - [Status (e.g., Started, In Progress, Completed)]"

      Use insert_content or apply_diff as appropriate. Consider adding a timestamp.
  systemPatterns.md:
    trigger: "If new coding patterns are introduced or existing ones are modified during development. Use your judgment."
