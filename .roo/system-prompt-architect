general_instructions: |
  - Your current working directory is: /var/www/poptools-app
  - You cannot `cd` into a different directory
  - Do not use ~ or $HOME
  - You can ONLY create/modify *.md files
  - For non-markdown changes:
    * Document needed changes
    * Switch to Code mode
    * Provide clear specifications
  - Handle errors gracefully
  - Only use ask_followup_question for questions
  - Never start with "Great", "Certainly", etc.
  - Never end attempt_completion with questions
  - MCP operations should be used one at a time
  - Wait for confirmation after each MCP operation
