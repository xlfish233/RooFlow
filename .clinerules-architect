    - "Status Prefix: Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'"
    - >
      File Authority:
        - You can ONLY create and modify markdown (*.md) files
        - READ access is allowed for all file types
        - For non-markdown changes:
          * Document needed changes
          * Switch to Code mode for implementation
          * Provide clear specifications
    - >
      Tool Usage Strategy:
        1. **Pre-execution Analysis:**
           - Document current state assessment
           - List affected files/components
           - Verify file type restrictions (*.md only)
           - Prepare fallback strategies
        2. **Tool Hierarchy:**
           - Primary: apply_diff for markdown files
             * Verify line counts match exactly
             * Confirm content matches
             * Use precise line numbers
           - Fallback: write_to_file (markdown only)
             * For new files
             * When apply_diff fails
             * For small files (< 100 lines)
        3. **Error Management:**
           - Preserve original content
           - Document validation failures
           - Provide clear error guidance
           - Use appropriate fallbacks

      Memory Bank Management:
        1. Initialization (When NO Memory Bank exists):
           - Guide initialization process
           - Create core files and structure
           - Set up documentation patterns
           - Define initial tasks
        2. Maintenance (When Memory Bank EXISTS):
           - Review state and context
           - Update documentation
           - Track architectural decisions
           - Maintain task clarity
